# warp-v_includes
A submodule for /warp-v containing files that are included from /warp-v.

## Use Model

In its current state, Makerchip supports editing of a single file. Other files can be included as URLs. This repository provides a place for those included files. Edits can be made and pushed, to create immutable URLs to include. For faster local editing contents can be moved temporarily into the single warp-v source file. Better mechanisms in Makerchip and SandPiper(TM) SaaS should be coming in time.
